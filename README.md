# CP1404 Practicals
## Sachh Moka

This repo contains all the practical work completed for CP1404 (Programming 2) at James Cook University

Important lessons of clean code:
- Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) - Each function must have one and only one purpose
- Ensure that variable names are appropriate (plurals for lists, singular for variables, etc.)
- Use already existing programming patterns, no need to reinvent the wheel

Here is a super useful guide for CP1401 and CP1402 at JCU: [Programming Patterns](https://github.com/CP1404/Starter/wiki/Programming-Patterns)

Here is a link to the CP1404 instructions repo: [CP1404 Practicals](https://github.com/CP1404/Practicals)
