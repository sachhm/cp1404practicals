# Instructions
Write some short but thoughtful comments about each of the following:
- regarding the estimates that you did for practical tasks, how was your accuracy and did your accuracy improve during the course of the subject?
- regarding code reviews, what have you learned from both being reviewed and doing reviews? 
- regarding the practical tasks overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

Include proper Markdown links to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past pracs.

# My Reflection
- My estimates for practical tasks were mostly similar to the actual time that it took. There were a couple of times, where I overestimated my abilities and gave shorter time frames than the actual time that it took (a memorable one is "wimbledon.py" from Prac 05). My estimates did improve over the course of the subject as I got better at estimating my own skills. 
- Regarding code reviews, I have learned that I can often learn from other people's code 
- If I was in charge of the subject, I would start teaching Kivy sooner rather than later, as it is a bit of a massive topic to cover in just one week.
